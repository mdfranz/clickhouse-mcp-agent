# Analysis Prompts

Analyze the output of these test runs against different models. Determine a ground truth of what the accurate result is and compare that across multiple models. Assess error messages and and count the number of tool calls that were used to get the results. Finally, rank the different models based on the criteria above. If there is additional data such as input and output tokens, use that as well.
